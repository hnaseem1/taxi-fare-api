# README

This is a final project for the Bitmaker 12-week Web Development Immersive coding bootcamp. A lot of sweat and blood went into this. We hope to keep it open-source for developers to re-use the code and continue to make peopleâ€™s lives easier!
This is a web app that essentially compares products of the biggest players of ride-sharing services. The app encourages competition within the crowdsourcing economy by making it easier for users to pick services based on fares, types and estimated times of arrival. Our app aims to bring people together who choose the same routes so they can save on costs by pooling rides together.
Highlights of the project:

* Web technologies used to develop this application are as follows: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Ajax, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3 and SASS.       

* Combines the power of MVC with jQuery and a sprinkle of HTML and CSS!

* Uses data from third-party APIs such as Uber, Lyft and Google APIs

* Uses Ajax to fetch data from our own API which sifts through the the data from third-party APIs so we can get the relevant information to our front-end

* Rails powered back-end REST API to support the front-end of the project, which developers can  use to further build native apps for cross platform integration. (contact us for a walkthrough of the endpoints!)

* Test-driven development, tests for edge cases included in the application

* Agile development model and MVP created in a week sprint.

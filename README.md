# README

This is a final project for the Bitmaker 12-week Web Development Immersive coding bootcamp. A lot of sweat and blood went into this. We hope to keep it open-source for developers to re-use the code and continue to make people's lives easier! 

This is a web app that essentially compares products of the biggest players of ride-hailing services. The app encourages competition within shared economy by making it easier for the user to pick and choose services based on fares, types and ETA. Our app aims to bring together people who choose the same routes so they can save on extra costs by pooling together. 

Highlights of the project:

* Most popular web technologies are used to develop this application such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Ajax, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3 and SASS 

* Uses data from third-party APIs such as Uber, Lyft and Google APIs

* Uses Ajax to fetch data from our own API that narrow up the data from third-party APIs so we can get fast and only required data for our front-end

* Rails powered back-end REST API to power up the front-end of the project, also developers can use the same endpoints as we do to further build native apps for cross platform integration.

* Test-driven development, tests for edge cases included in the application

* Agile development model and MVP created in a week sprint.
